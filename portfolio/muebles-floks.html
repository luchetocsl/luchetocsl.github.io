					Muebles Flok's has two services: They sell ready-made furniture and
					design custom furniture according to the space. Initially, they
					promoted their services separately, but too much time, money, and
					effort were spent on marketing without results.
				</p>

				<p>
					They wanted to fix their clients' onboarding process as well as
					minimize their spending on marketing.
				</p>

							It was essential for me to understand Flok's business. While
							talking to them, it was apparent one part of the business brings
							more revenue - while the other part brings more people through the
							door.
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					They approached me to help them understand their customers and their
					website's place in the onboarding process. This project aimed to know
					their customers from &quot;head to toe&quot; and design a website that
					helped them find the product they were looking for.
				</p>

				<p>
					The first step was to interview current customers. Flok's had a
					well-kept database of their current and past clients. However, they
					didn't know how or why their customers had chosen their customers
					Flok's for their projects.
				</p>

				<p>
					At the same time, the Flok's' members were unsure of the best path
					forward - every member had a different opinion on their best product.
				</p>

				<p>So, we decided we needed to tackle both problems separately.</p>

				<p>
					First, we needed to understand the business's goals. Although the
					users' needs and the business's goals go hand in hand, we needed to
					understand its relationship.
				</p>

				<p>
					We conducted a few interviews with the customers and found that most
					wanted custom furniture but arrived at the webpage after looking at
					the pre-made models.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img

					/>
					<figcaption>
						<p>
							This diagram is key to understanding Flok's. The flow in white is
							the most common path a user takes.
						</p>

						<p>
							The flow in gray is the flow desired for custom furniture. This,
							in turn, is the path that leads to more revenue for Flok's.
						</p>

						<p>
							We had to find a way to make users navigate both flows without
							discouraging them from making a purchase.
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					At the same time, custom-made furniture was a better business as
					Flok's earned more per project than by selling the other models. So,
					we decided to prioritize bespoke orders.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, we could not bury the current models as they still sold well,
					were responsible for most clientele, and were cheaper to produce.
				</p>

				<p>
					We merged the social media accounts and web pages under one umbrella.
					The merge allowed us better to communicate the relationship of both
					sections of the business.
				</p>

				<p>
					We knew our customers wanted original design - so we designed the
					homepage for storytelling about the problem of looking for custom
					design within a set budget and introduced Flok's as a solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					I designed the homepage to showcase the signature models while making
					it clear that custom design was an option.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img
						src="../../assets/img/floks/wireframesfloks-.jpg"
						alt="User flows"
					/>
					<figcaption>
						<p>
							It was during this step that we realized we didn't have the right
							assets. We decided to push forward. But in my opinion, the overall
							look and feel.
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					Once, we had a design that made sense. So I started developing the
					custom WordPress theme and used a multistep form to make ordering
					furniture easier while providing flok's information to quote designs.
				</p>

				<p>
					We decided on WordPress as we could leverage WooCommerce with a blog.
					I developed a custom content strategy where Flok's could communicate
					better how they are different from the competition.
				</p>

				<p>
					Also, as most of the clients of Flok's are buying custom furniture for
					the first time. The blog helped educate them on the different types of
					wood, metals, padding, and furniture elements.
				</p>

				<p>
					Up until now, the branding had been second a secondary thought. We
					used the designing/building process of the webpage to define some
					brand elements. Specially typography and colors.
				</p>

				<p>
					I created web elements, like buttons and forms, for the web style
					guide.
				</p>

				<p>
					The site and social media following traffic grew by 40% in the next
					six months, and Flok's received more custom orders.
				</p>

				<img
					src="../../assets/img/floks/floks-animated-screen.gif"
					alt="Main screen"
				/>

				<p>
					Flok's is looking to grow further. However, they are still far away
					from competitors like Gaia or Ikea - and even though their offering is
					different, their target market is the same.
				</p>

					src="../../assets/img/floks/mockup1floks-.jpg"
					alt="Main mockup 2"
				/>

				<p>
					We've conducted interviews and seen that not all the users understand
					the storytelling behind Flok's. So, we are looking at ways to make it
					more prominent and group content to create a better experience.
				</p>

				<p>
					We are also looking at other e-commerce platforms because WordPress
					seems challenging to scale as the site gets more visitors.

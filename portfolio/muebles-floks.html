	<section class="intro">
			<p>Muebles Flok's has two services: They sell ready-made furniture and design custom furniture according to the space. Initially, they promoted their services separately, but too much time, money, and effort were spent on marketing without results. </p>
			
			<p>They wanted to fix their clients' onboarding process as well as minimize their spending on marketing. </p>
			
			<p>They approached me to help them understand their customers and their website's place in the onboarding process. This project aimed to know their customers from &quot;head to toe&quot; and design a website that helped them find the product they were looking for. </p>
			
			
			<p>The first step was to interview current customers. Flok's had a well-kept database of their current and past clients. However, they didn't know how or why their customers had chosen their customers Flok's for their projects. </p>
			
			<p>At the same time, the Flok's' members were unsure of the best path forward - every member had a different opinion on their best product. </p>
			
			<p>So, we decided we needed to tackle both problems separately. </p>
			
			<p>First, we needed to understand the business's goals. Although the users' needs and the business's goals go hand in hand, we needed to understand its relationship. </p>
			
			<p>We conducted a few interviews with the customers and found that most wanted custom furniture but arrived at the webpage after looking at the pre-made models. </p>
			
			<p>At the same time, custom-made furniture was a better business as Flok's earned more per project than by selling the other models. So, we decided to prioritize bespoke orders. </p>
			
			<p>However, we could not bury the current models as they still sold well, were responsible for most clientele, and were cheaper to produce. </p>
			
			<p>We merged the social media accounts and web pages under one umbrella. The merge allowed us better to communicate the relationship of both sections of the business. </p>
			
			<p>We knew our customers wanted original design - so we designed the homepage for storytelling about the problem of looking for custom design within a set budget and introduced Flok's as a solution. </p>
			
			<p>I designed the homepage to showcase the signature models while making it clear that custom design was an option. </p>
			
			<p>Once, we had a design that made sense. So I started developing the custom WordPress theme and used a multistep form to make ordering furniture easier while providing flok's information to quote designs. </p>
			
			<p>We decided on WordPress as we could leverage WooCommerce with a blog. I developed a custom content strategy where Flok's could communicate better how they are different from the competition. </p>
			
			<p>Also, as most of the clients of Flok's are buying custom furniture for the first time. The blog helped educate them on the different types of wood, metals, padding, and furniture elements. </p>
			
			<p>Up until now, the branding had been second a secondary thought. We used the designing/building process of the webpage to define some brand elements. Specially typography and colors. </p>
			
			<p>I created web elements, like buttons and forms, for the web style guide. </p>
			
			<p>The site and social media following traffic grew by 40% in the next six months, and Flok's received more custom orders. </p>
			
			<p>Flok's is looking to grow further. However, they are still far away from competitors like Gaia or Ikea - and even though their offering is different, their target market is the same. </p>
			
			<p>We've conducted interviews and seen that not all the users understand the storytelling behind Flok's. So, we are looking at ways to make it more prominent and group content to create a better experience.</p>
			
			<p>We are also looking at other e-commerce platforms because WordPress seems challenging to scale as the site gets more visitors. </p>

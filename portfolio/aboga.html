      <section class="intro">

          src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/first_image.jpg"
          alt="Main screen"
        />
        <h2>The client</h2>

        <p>
          Aboga Online is a marketplace by and for lawyers. The website serves
          three purposes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>To be able to hire trustworthy, vetted lawyers</li>
          <li>A place for lawyers to network and solve problems together</li>
          <li>A hub where lawyers can find the latest news and webinars</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The problem</h2>

        <p>
          I was tasked to design and program the website from the ground up. The
          major hurdle was to show that Aboga Online is not just another
          marketplace looking for cheap labor.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, we needed to attract lots of lawyers. So the value
          of Aboga Online depends on the size of its community.
        </p>

        <h2>The solution</h2>

        <p>I designed a website with three distinct sections:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Job Board</li>
          <li>Community</li>
          <li>Events</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We grew to 200 members in the first two months.</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p>
          Most lawyers are specialists, so they rarely dabble in other cases.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, this doesn't stop their clients from asking fr other
          services. Instead, they are obliged to refer them to other lawyers.
          Lorelei approached me to design a site where lawyers could network and
          meet lawyers from other disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site should allow consolidated lawyers to create profiles and
          show off their past work while letting recent graduates find mentors
          or network to find a job.
        </p>

          src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/iphone_mockup.jpg"
          alt="Iphone Mockup"
        />

        <p>
          The first description of this site was &quot;LinkedIn for
          lawyers.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          We looked for communities for lawyers and realized that there are only
          offline communities in Mexico. So Aboga Online was the first online
          community for lawyers.
        </p>

        <img src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/ipad.jpg" alt="Ipad Mockup" />

        <p>
          We decided to focus our research on other established communities. For
          example, designers, developers, digital marketing experts, etc., are
          already running online communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most communities run either on &quot;circle.so&quot; or slack. We did
          a trial run with a few test subjects and realized that most lawyers
          are not tech-savvy enough to use either of these platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the project was financed by investors with specific rules,
          paying a monthly fee for a saas was an obstacle as they preferred to
          pay once and forget about it.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, we decided the whole platform would have to run on WordPress. This
          way, we would control every aspect of the platform.
        </p>

        <p>We found there would be four primary users of Aboga Online</p>

        <img src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/users.jpg" alt="Avatars" />

        <ul>
          <li>New graduates</li>
          <li>Consolidated lawyers</li>
          <li>Freelancers</li>
          <li>Lawyers looking for online education</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I created user flows for every type of visitor. This way, I noticed
          commonalities and designed the main screens.
        </p>

        <img
          src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/userflow.jpg"
          alt="User Flows"
        />

        <p>
          I used Figma to design three different homepages with the same content
          but different aesthetics. That way, it was easier for Lorelei to
          choose a look and feel for the rest of the site.
        </p>

        <img src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/mockups-1.jpg" alt="Mockups" />

        <p>Once we had a homepage, I could design the other screens.</p>

        <p>
          Before coding, we created a no-code version of the site to see if our
          users were following the flows as we intended. We used tools like air
          table, carrd, and slack.
        </p>

        <img
          src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/mockups.jpg"
          alt="Detailed Mockups"
        />

        <p>
          We realized our job board needed a filtering system. People were
          posting low-quality jobs, which in turn hurt our reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our solution was to make all jobs submitted archived for review
          instead of automatically publishing on the site.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also allowed me to show Lorelei and her investors all the moving
          pieces of the site. Thus, we prioritized which sections needed to be
          coded and completed first.
        </p>

        <img
          src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/screens.jpg"
          alt="Different screens"
        />

        <p>
          These changes meant we had to push the due date. However, we should
          save money and streamline the user flows in the long run.
        </p>

        <p>
          We launched in March of 2020 and grew to 200 members organically in
          the next two months. However, it was put on hold when Lorelei, the
          project owner, became ill and was no longer available to carry out the
          project.
        </p>

        <p>The domain is still registered, but it redirects to a blank page.</p>

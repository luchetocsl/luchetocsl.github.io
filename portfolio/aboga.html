							In the beginning, Aboga Online wanted to be everything for
							everyone.
						</p>

						<p>
							I felt it was essential to manage expectations. I do believe with
							enough work and time, Aboga can become as big as it needs to be,
							but growth needs to be planned.
						</p>

						<p>
							This is the list of all the features planned/mentioned at some
							point in our first meeting, and my final selection (marked with
							red ink)
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<section class="summary">
					<div>
						<h2>The client</h2>

						<p>
							Aboga Online is a marketplace by and for lawyers. The website
							serves three purposes:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>To be able to hire trustworthy, vetted lawyers</li>
							<li>
								A place for lawyers to network and solve problems together
							</li>
							<li>A hub where lawyers can find the latest news and webinars</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h2>The problem</h2>

						<p>
							I was tasked to design and program the website from the ground up.
							The major hurdle was to show that Aboga Online is not just another
							marketplace looking for cheap labor.
						</p>

						<p>
							At the same time, we needed to attract lots of lawyers. So the
							value of Aboga Online depends on the size of its community.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>The solution</h2>

						<p>I designed a website with three distinct sections:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Job Board</li>
							<li>Community</li>
							<li>Events</li>
						</ul>

						<p>We grew to 200 members in the first two months.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<h2>The Process</h2>

				<p>
					Most lawyers are specialists, so they rarely dabble in other cases.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, this doesn't stop their clients from asking fr other
					services. Instead, they are obliged to refer them to other lawyers.
					Lorelei approached me to design a site where lawyers could network and
					meet lawyers from other disciplines.
				</p>

				<p>
					This site should allow consolidated lawyers to create profiles and
					show off their past work while letting recent graduates find mentors
					or network to find a job.
				</p>

				<p>
					The first description of this site was &quot;LinkedIn for
					lawyers.&quot;
				</p>

				<p>
					We looked for communities for lawyers and realized that there are only
					offline communities in Mexico. So Aboga Online was the first online
					community for lawyers.
				</p>

				<img src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/ipad.jpg" alt="Ipad Mockup" />

				<p>
					We decided to focus our research on other established communities. For
					example, designers, developers, digital marketing experts, etc., are
					already running online communities.
				</p>

				<p>
					Most communities run either on &quot;circle.so&quot; or slack. We did
					a trial run with a few test subjects and realized that most lawyers
					are not tech-savvy enough to use either of these platforms.
				</p>

				<p>
					Since the project was financed by investors with specific rules,
					paying a monthly fee for a saas was an obstacle as they preferred to
					pay once and forget about it.
				</p>

				<p>
					So, we decided the whole platform would have to run on WordPress. This
					way, we would control every aspect of the platform.
				</p>

				<p>We found there would be four primary users of Aboga Online</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/users.jpg" alt="Avatars" />
					<figcaption>
						<p>
							Based on our interviews, we created three avatars. These avatars
							helped us understand the target audience and their paint points.
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<ul>
					<li>New graduates</li>
					<li>Consolidated lawyers</li>
					<li>Freelancers</li>
					<li>Lawyers looking for online education</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					I created user flows for every type of visitor. This way, I noticed
					commonalities and designed the main screens.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img
						src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/userflow.jpg"
						alt="User Flows"
					/>
					<figcaption>
						<p>
							The next step was to map the flow an average user would take to
							signup for an event.
						</p>
						<p>
							During this step, we noticed we didn't have a straightforward way
							to sign our users to the platform. We were relying solely on
							universities and practices to fill our databases
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					I used Figma to design three different homepages with the same content
					but different aesthetics. That way, it was easier for Lorelei to
					choose a look and feel for the rest of the site.
				</p>

				<img src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/mockups-1.jpg" alt="Mockups" />

				<p>Once we had a homepage, I could design the other screens.</p>

				<p>
					Before coding, we created a no-code version of the site to see if our
					users were following the flows as we intended. We used tools like air
					table, carrd, and slack.
				</p>

				<img
					src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/mockups.jpg"
					alt="Detailed Mockups"
				/>

				<p>
					We realized our job board needed a filtering system. People were
					posting low-quality jobs, which in turn hurt our reputation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our solution was to make all jobs submitted archived for review
					instead of automatically publishing on the site.
				</p>

				<p>
					It also allowed me to show Lorelei and her investors all the moving
					pieces of the site. Thus, we prioritized which sections needed to be
					coded and completed first.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img
						src="../../assets/img/aboga_online/screens.jpg"
						alt="Different screens"
					/>
					<figcaption>
						<p>
							We used FigJam, one of Figma's collaboration tools, to get the
							stakeholders on the same page. We were able to define the most
							important screens for one first step.
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					These changes meant we had to push the due date. However, we should
					save money and streamline the user flows in the long run.
				</p>

				<p>
					We launched in March of 2020 and grew to 200 members organically in
					the next two months. However, it was put on hold when Lorelei, the
					project owner, became ill and was no longer available to carry out the
					project.
				</p>

				<p>The domain is still registered, but it redirects to a blank page.</p>

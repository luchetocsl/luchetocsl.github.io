					<h2>The Client</h2>

					<p>
						Commander DeFi is the first community-run project in the BSC
						ecosystem. They are located all around the globe with people from
						the USA, Argentina, and Europe. The project started in 2020 but was
						finally made public at the end of 2021.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h2>The Challenge</h2>

					<p>
						Commander DeFi needed a website that made waves within the crypto
						crowd. However, as it is a community-led project with no clear
						boundaries, the primary challenge was to explain clearly what
						Commander DeFi is.
					</p>

					<p>
						A secondary challenge was to enable the pre-sale and eventual sale
						of $COMFI, Commander's proprietary token.
					</p>

					<p>
						This website needs to grow as more products are added to the
						Commander umbrella.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h2>The Solution</h2>

					<p>
						For this project, I collaborated closely with the current members of
						the Commander initiative. The team behind Commander had already
						chosen a few design elements - but it was mostly a blank canvas.
					</p>

					<p>
						I started with a competitive analysis to find the strengths and
						low-hanging differentiators. We also conducted small user research
						to see the most attractive for future investors.
					</p>

					<p>
						I created a mood board to help as inspiration. We were able to find
						modern examples that followed the aesthetics we were aiming for. The
						Commander must look like a current version of the '80s.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section class="intro">
				<h2>The Process</h2>

				<p>
					The team behind Commander DeFi contacted me to be the initial web
					designer. I was commissioned to design the overall experience from the
					first visit to the site to the buying of $COMFI (CommanderDeFi's
					property crypto coin).
				</p>

				<h2>Starting strong</h2>

				<p>
					The main goal of CommanderDeFi's website design was to make the coin
					and community known. Unfortunately, there is too much noise on the
					web3 and crypto space, so we needed to stand out from the rest.
				</p>

				<p>
					One of the biggest problems with Web3, in general, is that most users
					don't understand what it is all about. For that reason, our first task
					was to make an easy-to-understand statement of what makes Commander
					different from other coins.
				</p>

				<p>
					We looked at what other crypto ecosystems were offering and noticed
					that our greatest strength was community-led. There are bigger and
					smaller, simpler and more complex ecosystems, but none is
					community-based.
				</p>

				<p>
					We arrived at our slogan/elevator pitch: &quot;The most fun and
					engaging community project on the BSC.&quot;
				</p>

				<p>
					The purpose of this mantra is not to be a static, never-changing
					phrase. On the contrary, the unique selling point (USP) will change as
					the community grows in strength, members, and scope. But it serves as
					a starting line so that the current members know what they are signing
					in to.
				</p>

				<h2>Look and feel</h2>

				<p>
					The team member of Commander DeFi loosely defined the branding of
					Commander. They had only chosen what the first NFT would eventually
					look like and a few logo elements.
				</p>

				<p>
					The brand designer did not set up typefaces, colors, and design
					systems.
				</p>

						src="../../assets/img/commander/color_combinations.jpg"
						alt="Moodboards"
					/>
					<figcaption>
						<p>
							We had an overall look and feel. However, we were not sure about
							some details. We used these mockups to reach a final color palette
							(shown with the star).
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					I used the <strong>competition research</strong> from the step above
					to understand the common aesthetic elements. While we want to be
					unique, we want to attract the same people who are already investing
					in current similar technologies.
				</p>

				<figure>
					<img
						src="../../assets/img/commander/moodboards.jpg"
						alt="Moodboards"
					/>

					<figcaption>
						<p>
							During our initial interview, one thing mentioned was that
							Commander draws inspiration from 80s geek culture. In other words,
							Commander looks like 80s comics, retro-futurism, synth-wave
							aesthetics, the early internet, Tron, etc.
						</p>

						<p>I created a mood board based on this information.</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					I discovered many 80s properties that have been brought to the
					present, like:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>She-Ra</li>
					<li>He-Man</li>
					<li>The Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					While they all have unique visual elements, they also provide a
					roadmap to modernize the 80s aesthetic without losing its essence.
				</p>

				<h2>Homepage design</h2>

				<p>After the initial interviews, I started designing the website.</p>

				<img src="../../assets/img/commander/homepage.jpg" alt="Moodboards" />

				<p>
					We didn't have enough written information at the time of the first
					design as the project is meant to grow with the community,
				</p>

				<p>
					We used the StoryBrand Formula to create an engaging website with
					enough information to get our users excited and engaged.
				</p>

				<p>
					Early in the design, we created a one-pager with the essential
					information. Other sections, like terms of service, privacy policy,
					and the blog, while important, are not the reason why someone would
					visit the site.
				</p>

				<p>So, the navigation to these sections is relegated to the footer.</p>

				<p>
					The site's primary goal is to get people to sign up to the discord
					server and buy $COMFI. Therefore, I gave these goals a prominent
					placing to make them noticeable.
				</p>

				<p>
					I created some essential components to serve as the basis for new
					sections as the site grows.
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p>
					Working on this project has been eye-opening. I needed to learn many
					new things to understand what I was designing for and for whom.
				</p>

				<p>
					While web3 has been around for at least a decade, most of us are just
					learning about it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Contrary to other projects, this one is constantly growing, which is a
					challenge in itself. Whatever I design today might not reflect the
					most critical aspects of tomorrow. Trying to future-proof something
					that is still not wholly defined is a challenge like I've never had
					before.
				</p>

				<p>
					Understanding what Commander is about in itself was challenging,
					considering that not all the current members were in for the same
					reason.

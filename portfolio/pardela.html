      <section class="intro">
        <h2>The client</h2>

        <p>
          Pardela is a Mexican film production company with offices in
          Guadalajara and Mexico City. They've worked with Adidas, American
          Eagle, and Ben Q brands.
        </p>

        <h2>The challenge</h2>

        <p>
          In August 2021, Pardela won the opportunity to present its business to
          different brands, investors, and ad agency owners. Before that moment,
          Pardela had always pitched their showreel in person.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pardela needed a way to showcase their latest projects to a crowd and
          a way to let their prospects check their work at a later time.
        </p>

        <h2>The solution</h2>

        <p>
          Pardela contacted me to create an online portfolio that was easy to
          manage and update. We decided to focus heavily on their work, mainly
          because they worked with famous brands and have a solid aesthetic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pardela has never needed to promote itself. The quality of their work
          and the contacts they've made have. However, as they grew, they
          realized they needed to appear more professional before those who
          didn't know them.
        </p>

        <p>
          When they won the opportunity to showcase their work and pitch to
          investors and major players, they decided to up the branding to stand
          out from the rest of the market.
        </p>

        <h2>UX audit and research</h2>

        <p>
          The first step was to apply a UX audit and research to all of
          Pardela's digital real estate. They had signed up for different sites
          like YouTube and Vimeo, but everything was disconnected and branded
          differently.
        </p>

        <p>
          We defined user personas goals and developed user flows to understand
          the purpose of their website.
        </p>

        <h2>UI design and development</h2>

        <p>
          I approached the website as a repository of all the content they have
          created. I designed vital screens:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Homepage</li>
          <li>Portfolio Archive</li>
          <li>Portfolio items</li>
          <li>Blog</li>
          <li>Contact</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I then coded the website on WordPress, which allowed them to control
          the website.

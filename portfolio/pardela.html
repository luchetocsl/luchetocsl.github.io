					<h2>The client</h2>

					<p>
						Pardela is a Mexican film production company with offices in
						Guadalajara and Mexico City. They've worked with Adidas, American
						Eagle, and Ben Q brands.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>The challenge</h2>

					<p>
						In August 2021, Pardela won the opportunity to present its business
						to different brands, investors, and ad agency owners. Before that
						moment, Pardela had always pitched their showreel in person.
					</p>

					<p>
						Pardela needed a way to showcase their latest projects to a crowd
						and a way to let their prospects check their work at a later time.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>The solution</h2>

					<p>
						Pardela contacted me to create an online portfolio that was easy to
						manage and update. We decided to focus heavily on their work, mainly
						because they worked with famous brands and have a solid aesthetic.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section class="intro">
				<p>
					Pardela has never needed to promote itself. The quality of their work
					and the contacts they've made have. However, as they grew, they
					realized they needed to appear more professional before those who
					didn't know them.
				</p>

				<p>
					When they won the opportunity to showcase their work and pitch to
					investors and major players, they decided to up the branding to stand
					out from the rest of the market.
				</p>

				<h2>UX audit and research</h2>

				<p>
					The first step was to apply a UX audit and research to all of
					Pardela's digital real estate. They had signed up for different sites
					like YouTube and Vimeo, but everything was disconnected and branded
					differently.
				</p>

					<figcaption>
						<p>
							Pardela wanted minimal information on their website. Although, at
							first, it looked like it would make the project easier. Soon I
							found it very challenging to know what to leave in and what to
							leave out.
						</p>

					<img
						src="../../assets/img/pardela/avatars-pardela.jpg"
						alt="User Flow"
					/>
					<figcaption>
						<p>
							We defined user personas goals and developed user flows to
							understand the purpose of their website.
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h2>UI design and development</h2>

				<p>
					I approached the website as a repository of all the content they have
					created. I designed vital screens:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Homepage</li>
					<li>Portfolio Archive</li>
					<li>Portfolio items</li>
					<li>Blog</li>
					<li>Contact</li>
				</ul>

				<figure>
					<img src="../../assets/img/pardela/mockup_1.jpg" alt="Mockups" />
					<figcaption>
						<p>
							I designed two mockupsâ€”one with a more traditional layout and the
							other thinking of something that would break the grid.
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					I then coded the website on WordPress, which allowed them to control
					the website and update the content
				</p>

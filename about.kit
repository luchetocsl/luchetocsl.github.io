    <p>I am a UX/UI designer from Mexico City. Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://progroupx.com/">proGroupX</a> remotely. </p>

    <p>From 2015 to 2021, I worked at a small web design agency called &quot;CÃ³mo se llama&quot; which I founded, where we developed all kinds of websites, especially using WordPress. </p>

    <p>I am a vetted <a href="https://www.codeable.io/">Codeable</a> expert. Codeable is the only WordPress specialized freelancing site. </p>

    <p>I am always learning new things. Right now, I'm obsessed with UX processes and JamStack. However, in my free time, I'm learning about crypto and NFTs.</p>
